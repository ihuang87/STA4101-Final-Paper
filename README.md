This analysis examines the movie box office using data on major movies released between 2006 and 2015. 
The dataset was originally obtained from https://dasl.datadescription.com/datafile/movies_06-15/. Both the cleaned and the original datasets are available in this repository.
We try to analyze what the key contributing factors to a movie's box office are using linear regression and try to predict a movie's box office with its release date, genre, MPAA and Distributor.
